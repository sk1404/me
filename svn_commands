svn revert mod6.v

# svn log -r
Displays the commit log for a specific revision or range of revisions. Shows who committed, when, and the commit message.

Example:
svn log -r 5          # Shows commit info for revision 5
svn log -r 2:5        # Shows logs from revision 2 to 5

# What to do in case of a file conflict
1. Open the conflicted file and manually remove conflict markers like <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>.
2. After resolving, mark the file as resolved:
   svn resolve mod6.v --accept=working
3. Finally, commit the changes:
   svn commit -m "Resolved conflict in mod6.v"
